# Rideshare

About
---------------------------------------------------------------
This project aims to create a car rental system which allows users to rent different cars according to their availability for a certain amount. The admin monitors and facilitates the booking and renting of cars by keeping track of the cars currently in use, distance driven in each car and the amount earned by each car in the fleet. 

The system can also generate a graph which helps gain insights such as the most popular car, the most distance travelled by a car, the car which has earned the most amount of money for the company and so on.
